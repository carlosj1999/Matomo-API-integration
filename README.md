# Matomo-API-integration
This project demonstrates the integration of Matomo's API to fetch and analyze user visit data in real-time. The implementation uses a custom APIClient class to interact with Matomo's API, retrieve user visit details, and provide insights on user activity such as login events and payment submissions.
